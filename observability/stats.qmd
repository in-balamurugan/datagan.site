# Netflix Games: Detecting Broken Gameplay Using Log Clustering

At Netflix, the SRE team for Netflix Games focuses on monitoring key network performance metrics such as latency bitrate and packet loss\
However, these metrics alone don’t always reveal when a game is actually *broken* from the player’s perspective.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Challenge

In some countries, popular Netflix games remained broken for up to three weeks — clearly unacceptable for player experience.\
Traditional indicators, such as:

-   Gameplay duration
-   User feedback forms

were too weak to reliably detect broken games.

To address this, the team decided to focus deeply on one strong signal:

> **Gameplay time \< 120 seconds**

This metric served as a practical proxy for identifying failed or frustrating game sessions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Approach: Log Clustering Pipeline

To understand the root causes behind short gameplay sessions, the team developed a log clustering pipeline\
The process includes the following stages:

### 1. Selection & Filtering

-   Select logs containing relevant keywords such as `exception`, `error`, and `warning`.

### 2. Preprocessing

-   Mask PII (Personally Identifiable Information) to ensure privacy.\
-   Keep only the first line of multi-line logs for consistency.\
-   Normalize dynamic content (e.g., timestamps, IDs) to reduce noise and minimize the number of distinct log entries.

### 3. Vectorization

-   Convert log text into numerical vectors using the Sentence Transformer package.

### 4. Clustering

-   Apply DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to group similar log messages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Results

-   From over 20 million lines of logs\*\*, the process produced approximately 130 meaningful clusters, each pointing to a distinct problem area.\
-   The results were evaluated using a confusion matrix, measuring:
    -   **Precision**
    -   **Recall**
    -   **F1 Score**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Current Status & Future Work

-   The system currently runs hourly, providing near-real-time insights into potential issues.\
-   The next step for the team is to reduce alerting latency to improve detection and response speed even further.

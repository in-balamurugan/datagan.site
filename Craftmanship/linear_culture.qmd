Linear Culutre
Big Tech experience builds credibility, skills, and makes fundraising easier for founders.

Linear’s idea formed from two insights: ICs dislike manager-oriented tools, and product teams lack a consistent methodology.

Company mission: help teams build better software; start with IC-friendly issue tracking and grow to compete with enterprise tools.

Early team composition: two engineers and one designer with complementary strengths.

First hires came from the founders’ network; contractors were converted to full-time after proving fit.

Hire people who can later lead functions (e.g., customer success lead hired early to handle support load).

Linear stayed full-remote from day one; focus and minimal meetings are key benefits.

Remote made hiring juniors harder, so they hired seniors who need little mentoring.

Work is organized by time zones to reduce daily cross-timezone collaboration.

In-person gatherings happen ~twice a year to align on long-term vision.

Tech stack is intentionally “normal”: TypeScript, React, Node, Postgres, Redis (queues), MongoDB (caching), GraphQL, on GCP with Kubernetes.

A proprietary sync engine handles replication, offline mode, networking, and errors so feature work doesn’t depend on backend changes.

Choosing a mainstream stack lets any engineer solo build most features end-to-end.

Linear invests in infrastructure early (e.g., Kubernetes, sync engine) to stay small and move fast later.

Culture empowers engineers to choose much of their work; a few major projects plus self-selected smaller tasks.

Linear Method highlights: set direction with a roadmap and milestones; write simple tasks (not user stories); build with users; publish a changelog.

They break their own method when it isn’t the right fit for a situation.

Hiring philosophy: “hire less, but hire the best”; very high bar and slow growth.

Interview process: practical coding and architecture interviews (no algorithms), followed by a paid week-long work trial on a real, greenfield task.

Hiring slowly contributed to early profitability, despite available funds.

Big Tech learning: large codebases make architectural change expensive; continually improve architecture and compartmentalization early.

Big Tech learning unlearned: heavy reliance on A/B testing; for tools like Linear, intuition and customer research matter more than analytics.

Hypergrowth pitfalls observed at Uber: rapid headcount growth, brittle first-gen systems, years-long migrations, and most engineers ending up on infrastructure.

Linear aims to keep software engineering a product problem so engineers focus on customer value, not just infrastructure.

Founders advise leveraging Big Tech pedigree when starting a company and building an online audience to kick-start adoption.
